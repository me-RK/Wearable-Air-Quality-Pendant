In our modern indoor environments, air quality can significantly impact our health, productivity, and overall well-being. Poor indoor air quality from volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) released by furniture, cleaning products, paints, and everyday activities often goes unnoticed until it becomes a serious concern. Unlike outdoor pollution that we can see or smell, indoor air contamination is typically invisible and odorless, making it difficult to detect without proper monitoring equipment.

This project addresses that invisible threat by creating an intelligent air quality monitoring system that provides real-time feedback about your indoor environment. Using advanced sensor technology, the monitor continuously tracks TVOC levels and translates complex air quality data into simple, intuitive visual and audible alerts that anyone can understand at a glance.

The system employs an SGP40 sensor to measure Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) index, providing professional-grade air quality monitoring in a compact, easy-to-build package. The monitor uses a sophisticated multi-modal alert system combining smooth LED color transitions with carefully crafted musical tone sequences to communicate different air quality levels. Green LEDs with gentle tones indicate clean air, while escalating yellow and red warnings with more urgent sounds alert you when air quality degrades, ensuring you can take appropriate action before health impacts occur.
